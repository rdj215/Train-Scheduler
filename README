I was able to connect my site to firebase and store the information that was input into the search fields, but unable to 
retrieve the information to dispaly it on the site (played with childSnaphot for a while). Also had trouble connecting moment.js and applying to script. After reading documentation
I believe the .toNow is the method I would have wanted to use. Essentially I ran out of time because I do think I could have got the site working.
